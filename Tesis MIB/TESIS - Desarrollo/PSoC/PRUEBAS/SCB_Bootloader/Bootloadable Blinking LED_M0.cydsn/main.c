*                           THEORY OF OPERATION
* This is a blinking LED project. A PWM component drives the pin to blink the 
* LED at regular intervals. This project contains a bootloadable component so 
* that it can be bootloaded into PSoC 4 which has a bootloader already programmed 
* into it.
* Default UART Port Configuration for bootloading the PSoC 4 in CY8CKIT-049-42xx
* Baud Rate : 115200 bps
* Data Bits : 8
* Stop Bits : 1
* Parity    : None
